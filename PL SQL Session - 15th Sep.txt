PL : procedural Language
=================================
Table : is physical structure where data can be stored /saved

View :  is virtual table wehre struture will be stored and data will 	come at execution time from physical table 
	-> is also known as wrapper over the table 
	-> Project, Selection  (expose the required columns/rows)
	-> To merge two or more than two tables as expose as single 		table 
Trigger : is kind of stored procedure/sql program(set of instructions) which 	execute/invoke automatillay when DML (insert,update,delete) command will fire 	on a table

	There are following types of trigger:
		-before / instead of
			-insert
			-update
			-delete
		-after
			-insert
			-update
			-delete 

	Emp 
		Trigger on Emp table 
				instead of  insert
	Emp_Back
		

	insert into emp .....
	1. trigger will be fire 
	2. data will be saved in emp_back table 
	3. data can be also saved in emp  	


	after insert 

	1. data can be saved in emp  
	2. trigger will be fire
	3. data will be saved in emp_back table

	There are two virtual or magic table:
		-inserted
				after/intead of 
					insert
					update 
		-deleted 
				after/instead of 
					update
					delete 


	Use case of trigger :
		-> store to logs 

			We wil place the order
			Order assign/tranfer to vendor
			Vendor will pack the product and ship that 
			Shipment -> Tranportatio n
			Delivery 

	Table:Order
		oid cid   pid    date 		quantity  status by_user(action by)
		1    100  1002   2018-09-16 11:10	10	   1	-new order
		2     201  11    						-assign to vendor
		
	Table:Order_Status 
		oid  status date_time 			 by_user(action by)
		1     1      11:10			  1122
		1     2      13:20			  jatin
		1     3       18:30			
		1     4       2018-09-20 6:00

Loop: is iterator or repeation of satement 
================
Example :
	1 2 3 4 ...100
	100  ...    1

Fundamental of loop:
	-init/start		:  1		100	
	-condition/limit	: 100		1
	-increment/decrement    : +1 		-1
	
	
declare @i as int =1		--init 
while @i<=100			--condition 
begin
		select @i 
		set @i = @i +1	--increment

end
